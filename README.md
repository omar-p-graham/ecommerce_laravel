## Overview

This e-commerce application leverages the TALL stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire) to create a modern, responsive, and dynamic shopping experience.

- Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling, allowing for rapid and customizable UI development.
- Alpine.js adds interactivity with minimal JavaScript, making the app reactive and user-friendly.
- Laravel serves as the robust backend framework, handling everything from routing to database management with ease.
- Livewire integrates seamlessly with Laravel to enable dynamic, real-time updates without the need for complex JavaScript.
